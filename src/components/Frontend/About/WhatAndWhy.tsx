          Accent is a talent placement company. This means that we are an
          important link between talent on the labour market and employers. For
          jobseekers, we are a job coach, identifying and helping them discover
          their talents. For companies, we are a true HR partner, not only
          looking for the right talent for the right job, but also providing
          advice and support to retain that talent.

        <p>
          Our dream is that “we will embrace every talent and spark joy in their
          lives”. We want to get every talent, whatever their shape, size or
          colour, into the right place and, by doing this, achieve maximum job
          satisfaction for them. That’s because people who are happy in their
          jobs stay with the same employer longer, perform better and are
          important for the growth of any company. A win-win situation!
