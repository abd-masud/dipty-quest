        <p className="text-center">
          Our dream perfectly reflects the culture of our organisation. But to
          make the dream tangible, we have three values that we pursue.
        </p>
        <div className="grid md:grid-cols-3 grid-cols-1 gap-10 mt-10">
          <p>
            The first value is ‘stay gutsy’. For our clients, this means showing
            genuine interest in their business and listening to their needs and
            requirements. For our candidates, this means looking beyond a CV or
            cover letter, putting effort into really getting to know each
            candidate and focusing on their talent rather than their experience
            – just as a real job coach would. Here with us, every Accenter
            treats the person they are speaking to like a close friend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our second value is ‘stay gutsy’. At Accent, you are given the space
            to try, to be enterprising, to take risks, to make mistakes. Being
            bold has long been part of our DNA. It has brought us to where we
            are today: one of the big HR players in Belgium. In our early years,
            we were seen as an enfant terrible. Now we are seen as an example
            for the sector. We dare to tread new paths, like true pioneers. We
            are still the innovators, and we definitely want to stay that way,
            which is why we ask all our employees to show courage. We would
            rather you be bold and make mistakes and learn from them than always
            play it safe. And, even in difficult times, we always choose the
            right path rather than the easiest one. We make a point of staying
            gutsy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third value is most closely aligned with our primary mission:
            ‘go pro’. Our founders made the bold choice 25 years ago to focus on
            the smaller segment of temporary work with a permanent employment
            option – the most sustainable approach to temporary agency work. We
            prefer quality and professionalism over quantity and focus on
            like-minded clients who are willing to pay a little more for all our
            additional services. We are not about putting people in pigeonholes.
            We are all about individually placing talent in the right
            environment and matching desires and expectations as human beings.
            This is customisation with a personal touch, not an industrial
            assembly line. Go pro therefore means that we are and remain
            professional, always, everywhere and with everyone. We do this by
            learning from each other, by coaching each other, by always striving
            for better, by helping each other and by sharing experiences. We
            exude that professionalism every single day, towards colleagues,
            candidates and clients. Go pro is for all of us.
